Debugging
======================

1. "Failed to open USB device" error.
Usually this can be solved if you unplug the USB cable and re-plug the DYNAP-SE1
board to your machine. If not, it's probably due to the installation. You 
should update your udev rules by doing the following.

* Make a file in /etc/udev/rules.d/ called 60-inilabs.rules

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /etc/udev/rules.d
    cat 60-inilabs.rules

* Put the lines below into this file:

.. code-block:: 

    # All DVS/DAVIS/Dynap-se systems
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="152a", ATTR{idProduct}=="84[0-1]?", MODE="0666"

* Then, you run this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    udevadm control --reload-rules

2. The GUI and `matplotlib.pyplot` may not work depending on your system.
  - If you get the error below, please `open_dynapse1` without GUI.
    > samna.open_remote_node(visualizer_id, viz_name)
    RuntimeError: Store with ID: 3 timed out on content request

  - If you get the error below, please avoid importing `matplotlib.pyplot` 
  together with `Samna`.
